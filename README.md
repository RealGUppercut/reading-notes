# About Me

Hi! I'm Joe Venton and I'm currently studying with [Tech Educators Norwich](https://techeducators.co.uk).  
I'm enrolled on their 10-week full-stack coding course, looking to gain some skills and experience to allow me to find employment as a developer.  
I haven't got any previous experience in coding but I'm **very** eager to learn!  
My public GitHub repositories can be found [here](https://github.com/RealGUppercut).

My profile picture is a character called ***Purple Tentacle*** from a video game I loved as a child, [Day of the Tentacle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Tentacle).

This is also due to the fact that there aren't any pictures of me taken in the last 10 years where I look better than a weird, slimy tentacle guy.

# Maintaining a Growth Mindset during this course:
### What is a Growth Mindset?
+ A Growth Mindset is a way of approaching the process of learning new skills.  
+ Firstly accepting a **flexible** attitude to personal progress (specifically that an individuals capacity for learning is never static), means that learning is achievable for *everyone* when effort is applied over time.
+ Learners accept that the are obstacles that will be encountered during education are temporary. By fully embracing the idea that an individuals skills will improve over time, a learner will be able to process and overcome various negative feelings they may experience.  

This image demonstrates how a **Growth Mindset** can help to overcome some common obstacles to learning resulting from a **Fixed Mindset**:

### How will I try to adopt a Growth Mindset?
+ #### Managing feelings of inadequecy
I will remind myself that I am more than capable of **learning**.  
I will remember **The Learning Pit** and recall previous times when learning new concepts has been difficult but I have eventually succeeded.  
![Example of The Learning Pit concept](learningpit.jpg)

+ #### Being mindful of what has been achieved so far
At the time of writing this page, I have been studying for two days.  
I am pleased with the progress I have made so far so there isn't any reason why this won't continue throughout the course.  

+ #### Being prepared to encounter new topics  
Reading ahead in the course material will help me avoid feeling overwhelmed when a lot of new information is presented over a short amount of time.
